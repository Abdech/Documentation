                      <p> 
                        There are several definitions of GIS (Geographic Information Systems), 
                        which is not simply a program. In general, GIS are systems that allow for
                        the use of geographic information (data have spatial coordinates).
                          In particular, GIS allow for the view, query, calculation and analysis 
                          of spatial data, which are mainly distinguished in raster or vector data 
                          structures. Vector is made of objects that can be points, lines or polygons,
                          and each object can have one ore more attribute values; a raster is a grid
                            (or image) where each cell has an attribute value (Fisher and Unwin, 2005). 
                            Several GIS applications use raster images that are derived from remote sensing.

                                <h4>  What is remote sensing and what is it used for?</h4>

                              
                Remote sensing is the process of detecting and monitoring the physical characteristics of an area by measuring its reflected and emitted radiation at a distance (typically from satellite or aircraft). Special cameras collect remotely sensed images, which help researchers "sense" things about the Earth. Some examples are:
                <ul>
                  <li>Cameras on satellites and airplanes take images of large areas on the Earth's surface,
                    allowing us to see much more than we can standing on the ground.</li>
                    <li>Sonar systems on ships can be used to create images of the ocean floor 
                      without needing to travel to the bottom of the ocean.</li>

                      <li>Cameras on satellites can be used to make images of 
                        temperature changes in the oceans.</li>
                        <br>
                <strong> Specific uses of remotely sensed images of the Earth include:</strong>

                <li>Large forest fires can be mapped from space, 
                  allowing rangers to see a much larger area than from the ground.</li>
                <li>Tracking clouds to help predict the weather or
                  watching erupting volcanoes, and help watching for dust storms.</li>
                <li>Tracking the growth of a city and changes in 
                  farmland or forests over several years or decades.</li>
                <li>Discovery and mapping of the rugged topography of 
                  the ocean floor (e.g., huge mountain ranges, deep canyons, 
                  and the “magnetic striping” on the ocean floor).</li></ul>

                <p> 
                  A general definition of Remote Sensing is “the science and technology by which the
                  characteristics of objects of interest can be identified, measured or analyzed the
                    characteristics without direct contact” (JARS, 1993).
                  Usually, remote sensing is the measurement of the energy that is emanated from
                  the Earth’s surface. If the source of the measured energy is the sun, then it is 
                  called passive remote sensing, and the result of this measurement can be a digital 
                  image (Richards and Jia, 2006). If the measured energy is not emitted by the Sun but 
                  from the sensor platform then it is defined as active remote sensing, such as radar 
                  sensors which work in the microwave range (Richards and Jia, 2006).
                  The electromagnetic spectrum is “the system that classifies, according to wavelength, 
                  all energy (from short cosmic to long radio) that moves, harmonically, at the constant
                  velocity of light” (NASA, 2013). Passive sensors measure energy from the optical
                    regions of the electromagnetic spectrum: visible, near infrared (i.e. IR),
                    short-wave IR, and thermal IR (see Figure  <a href="https://semiautomaticclassificationmanual-v5.readthedocs.io/fr/latest/_images/Electromagnetic-Spectrum.png">Electromagnetic-Spectrum).</a>

                  The interaction between solar energy and materials depends on the wavelength; solar energy goes from the Sun to the Earth and then to the sensor. Along this path, solar energy is (NASA, 2013):
                  <ul id="uls">
                    <li> 
                    <em>Transmitted</em> - The energy passes through with a change in
                      velocity as determined 
                      by the index of refraction for the two media in question.
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                      <em>Absorbed</em> - The energy is given up to the
                      object through electron or molecular reactions.
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                    <em>Reflected</em> - The energy is returned unchanged with the angle
                      of incidence equal to the angle of reflection. Reflectance is 
                    the ratio of reflected energy to that incident on a body. 
                      The wavelength reflected (not absorbed) determines the color
                      of an object.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <em>Scattered</em> - The direction of energy propagation is randomly changed.
                      Rayleigh and Mie scatter are the two most important types of scatter in
                      the atmosphere.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <em>Emitted</em> - Actually, the energy is first absorbed, 
                      then re-emitted, usually at longer wavelengths. The object heats up.          </li>
                  </ul>

                  Sensors can be on board of airplanes or on board of satellites, 
                  measuring the electromagnetic radiation at specific ranges (usually called bands).
                  As a result, the measures are quantized and converted into a digital image,
                    where each picture elements (i.e. pixel) has a discrete value in units of 
                    Digital Number (DN) (NASA, 2013). The resulting images have different characteristics 
                    (resolutions) depending on the sensor. There are several kinds of resolutions:
                          </p>
                <p>
                  <ul id="uls">
                    <li> 
                    <em>Spatial resolution,</em> - 
                    usually measured in pixel size, “is the resolving power of an instrument
                      needed for the discrimination of features and is based on detector size, 
                      focal length, and sensor altitude” (NASA, 2013); 
                    spatial resolution is also referred to as geometric resolution or IFOV;
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                      <em> Spectral resolution,</em> -
                      is the number and location in the electromagnetic spectrum
                      (defined by two wavelengths) of the spectral bands 
                      (NASA, 2013) in multispectral sensors, for each band corresponds an image;
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                    <em>Reflected</em> - The energy is returned unchanged with the angle
                      of incidence equal to the angle of reflection. Reflectance is 
                    the ratio of reflected energy to that incident on a body. 
                      The wavelength reflected (not absorbed) determines the color
                      of an object.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <em>Radiometric resolution</em> - 
                    , usually measured in bits (binary digits), is the range of available
                      brightness values, which in the image correspond to the maximum range of DNs; 
                      for example an image with 8 bit 
                    resolution has 256 levels of brightness (Richards and Jia, 2006);

                    <li>
                      For satellites sensors, there is also the <em>temporal resolution</em> -  
                      temporal resolution, which is the time required for revisiting the same area 
                      of the Earth (NASA, 2013).

                  Sensors measure the radiance, which corresponds 
                  to the brightness in a given direction toward the sensor; 
                  it useful to define also the reflectance as the ratio of 
                  reflected versus total power energy.

              <code>      The spectral signature is the reflectance as a function of wavelength (
                      see Figure Spectral Reflectance Curves of Four Different Targets);
                      each material has a unique signature, therefore it can be used for 
                      material classification (NASA, 2013).</code>

                  Landsat is a set of multispectral
                  satellites developed by the NASA 
                  (National Aeronautics and Space Administration of USA), since 
                  the early 1970’s.</p>
                  
                  
                <p>Landsat images are very used for environmental research. The
                  resolutions of Landsat 4 and Landsat 5 sensors are reported in the following 
                table (from http://landsat.usgs.gov/band_designations_landsat_satellites.php); also, Landsat temporal resolution is 16 days (NASA, 2013).
